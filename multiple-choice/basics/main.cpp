    // Testing out static variables (see function definition below)
    // A static variable inside a function retains its value between calls.
    // It is only initialized once and then "remembers" its value across calls.
    //
    // In `static_variables()`, the first time it's called, `static_int` is 0 and becomes 1.
    // On the second call, it continues from 1, becoming 2.
    //
    // This happens because static variables are stored in the data segment,
    // not re-created on each function call like local variables.
    //
    // Just imagine that the definition of the variable is *skipped* after the first call,
    // and youâ€™re always working with the same instance.
